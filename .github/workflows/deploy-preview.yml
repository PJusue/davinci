            ## ðŸš€ Preview Deployment

            Your preview deployment is being processed!

            **Note**: To deploy to Vercel, you need to:
            1. Install the Vercel GitHub App
            2. Connect your repository to Vercel
            3. Configure the \`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\` environment variable in Vercel

            Once configured, Vercel will automatically deploy previews for each PR.
              `
            });
